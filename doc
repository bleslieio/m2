	Installation

			(includes some extra stuff for development mode)
		git submodule init
		git submodule update

		vagrant up
		composer install
			(packagist)

		gui install

	Working With M2
	----------------
		core -> lib/Magento/Framework


		Creating a module
		------------------
		registration.php
			can copy from elsewhere, just need to make sure the module name is correct

		etc/module.xml


		php bin/magento module:enable Interactone_Sample
		php bin/magento setup:upgrade4


		event observers
			events.xml
				frontend / admin
			execute method rather than module declaration (like controllers)

		plugins
			override core methods
			before, after, "around"
				around 
					gives you the method to call so you can do stuff before & after without having to use 2 plugins
					multiple people can alter the same method without conflicts

		preference
			fundamentally override functionality of a class
			not just overriding one method

		service contract
			no matter what, the methods will always be the same in m2
			ensures stability
			if you're altering something w/ a service contract, you must uphold that service contract

		create a new controller
			create a route
				routes.xml
				creates front name
					first part of the URL
			create a class

			URL structure
				frontName/Folder/Controller

			namespace 	= path to the controller file
			class 		= controller file name
			extends 	= framework class it should extend


			can use 'use' then action path.. extends the file name
				if there are conflicts, can 'use path as alias' then extends alias


		create plugin
			di.xml
				type name 	= class you want to intercept
				plugin name = unique name
				type 		= new class

			model/plugin/hello.php
				namespace
				class

			*plugins are always models
